"""Pillar 2 — Smart GPU scheduling.

Behavior-aware placement: rank nodes by *predicted* free capacity (from the
demand head), health and failure risk instead of static resource requests.
Designed to back a Kubernetes Scheduler Framework plugin: the API response is
a direct scoring input to a Filter+Score cycle.
